contextify skill eval: machine-checkable static assertions on skills/contextify/SKILL.md.

This is the deterministic half of the eval suite. It encodes the house contract and the
contextify design lock as pass/fail checks, so a regression is caught in CI rather than in
someone's security report. It was written BEFORE the skill existed and run once against the
missing file (RED: not found, exit 1); see evals/RED-baseline.md. The behavioral half, a cold
model asked to audit an app's security with no skill installed, is recorded in the same file.

What it enforces:
  - frontmatter keys present and well-formed (name, description, license, metadata.version,
    argument-hint), with the version quoted and never at the top level;
  - the description is WHEN-only, carries the story sentence verbatim, and sits in the house
    length range;
  - the required section headings are all present and in the right order;
  - no emoji in any heading, and no em dash anywhere in the file;
  - the body stays under 600 lines, so the depth lives in references/;
  - every references/*.md path the body mentions exists on disk;
  - the control sections give orders, not advice ("you should" and friends are banned there).

Usage:
    python3 evals/check_skill.py [path-to-SKILL.md]   # default: skills/contextify/SKILL.md
Exit code 0 = all checks pass, 1 = at least one failed. Standard library only.
