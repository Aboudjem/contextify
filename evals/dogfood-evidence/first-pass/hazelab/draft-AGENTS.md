# HazeLab
## Commands
- Development from the repository root: `pnpm run dev`.
- Build: `pnpm run build`; this generates the Prisma client before building Next.js.
- Lint: `pnpm run lint`.
## Testing
- No test script is declared in `package.json`; do not assume a package-manager test command exists.
- `vitest.config.ts` selects jsdom and discovers TypeScript tests under the tests directory.
## Read when relevant
- `prisma.config.ts` sets the schema and migration locations; read it before changing database tooling.
